Quantum Computing Collective Spring 2021 Schedule
========================================

## Events

- Beginner Labs:
    - Weekly Events focused on providing members with updates on developments in the world of quantum computing and research conducted by members of QCC followed by bite-sized lessons on foundational topics in the field.

- Intermediate Labs(Theory):
    - Bi-weekly events that serve to introduce theory and background for a given concept or method. We will try to make Intermediate Labs as accessible as possible to beginners, thus the only prerequisite is basic familiarity with python and linear algebra.
 
- Intermediate Labs (Implementation):
    - Bi-weekly events in which members will collaboratively implement the method discussed in the previous weeks Intermediate Theory lab.

- Literature Discussions:
    - Monthly events in which we will discuss the paper chosen as reading for that month. Though this is an event focused at researchers, any and all members are welcome and encouraged to participate! 

- Semester Research Endeavor Meetings:
    - Weekly events in which researchers meet to discuss their work and collaborate on projects.
    - Note: days/times are not on schedule yet as they will be determined according to what fits the schedule of the majority of the researchers.


## Next Semester

Since we have found ourselves starting this collective during the painfully annoying zoom university days, we predict that attendance will be lower than during an in-person semester... For this reason, we are planning on postponing speaker events and career workshops until Fall 2021. The concentration this semester will be Education Labs, Literature Discussions, and Semester Research Endeavors.

We are also in the process of planning a QCC-hosted Quantum Computing Hackathon at UT Austin Fall 2021, more info on that soon.
